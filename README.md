# Brewery_Render
Description: This exercise uses React and Babel to create a search bar that queries the openbrewerydb API to get a list of breweries based on a search term.

How To Run: go to https://jmobarry.github.io/Brewery_Render/ Type a search term into the search bar and press submit. This will load a list of breweries and if they have a website the listing will be underlined.

Roadmap: Be able to filter out items that have state names in areas other than {item.state}
